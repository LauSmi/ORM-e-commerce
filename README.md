## Description

The challenge for this project was to build the back end portion of an e-commerce site using starter code provided. The front end portion was provided with the starter code. Once the back end was built, the API was tested using Postman. The application uses Node.js, Express.js, dotenv, and MySQL.

## Installation

The application uses Node.js, Express.js, dotenv, and MySQL. Run npm install in the root directory to download these dependencies. Since it interacts with a SQL database, a SQL interface is also required.

From the command line, run:

`npm init`

`npm install mysql2`

`npm install sequelize`

`npm install express`

`npm install dotenv`

`npm run start`


## Usage

Once all the packages have been installed, open terminal and run the following:

`npm run seed`

`npm run start`

Navigate to Postman or other API testing site and test the Categories, Products, and Tags using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
